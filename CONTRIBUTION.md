# Contributing to [My_Powershell_Profile]

Thank you for your interest in contributing [My_Powershell_Profile]! The purpose of this repository is to store and share my personal functions, aliases, and settings. I welcome suggestions, bug fixes, and new features that might be helpful to others as well.

Following these guidelines helps ensure a smooth experience for both contributors and project maintainers.

## How to contribute

* **A clear title** that summarizes the suggestion.
* **A detailed description** of what the feature does and why it would be useful.
* **Any relevant code** if you have already written it.

### Reporting bugs

If you find a bug in any of the existing functions or settings, please open an issue. When reporting a bug, provide as much detail as possible:

* **A clear and descriptive title** for the bug report.
* **The steps to reproduce the issue.**
* **What you expected to happen vs. what actually happened.**
* **Relevant environment details,** such as your PowerShell version (`$PSVersionTable`).

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Create** a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-name`).
