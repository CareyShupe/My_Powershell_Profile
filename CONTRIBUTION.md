## How to contribute

### Reporting bugs
We use GitHub Issues to track public bugs. Before creating a new issue, please check the existing issues to see if the bug has already been reported.
A good bug report should be clear, concise, and contain all the information necessary for a maintainer to reproduce the bug.

When you report a bug, please include the following information:
*   A clear, descriptive title.
*   The steps to reproduce the bug.
*   The behavior you expected and the behavior you observed.
*   Any relevant details about your environment, such as the operating system and project version.

### Suggesting enhancements
We welcome suggestions for new features and enhancements.
*   **Before submitting a suggestion,** check the issue tracker to see if a similar idea has already been proposed.
*   **When submitting a suggestion,** provide a detailed description of the proposed enhancement and explain why it would be useful.

### Your first code contribution
We are happy to guide you through your first contribution. The general workflow is as follows:
1.  **Fork the repository** to your own GitHub account.

3.  **Make your changes**, following the project's [coding style guidelines](#style-guides).
4.  **Create a pull request (PR)** with a clear title and description of your changes.
